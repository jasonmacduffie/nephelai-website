The local chieftains have no formal authority, but are respected by the Imperial provincial governor as representatives of their clans. The region is divided between the western chieftains of the Highchill Mountains who demand greater autonomy, and the eastern chieftains of the Shifting Foothills who willingly submit to Imperial oversight.</p>

Secondly are the Oto foothills in the center, which is filled with orchards and vinyards. Last are the Koha Highlands to the south, which are forested and haunted. Halflings of Middlestone are fervently loyal to the Yargyez Empire on the surface, but they are also hostile to outsiders and prone to feuding over land rights. Middlestone is governed by land-owning Halfling nobles who ultimately answer to the Imperial governor.</p>

<h3>Valorgale</h3>

<center>

Each of the Ashfallen Tribes has a distinct disposition towards the Yargyez Empire. Distinctly, the Pataf Tribe is conspiring with the Synomachos, the Osti Tribe is reviving worship of the Archon Dreze, and the Tivik Tribe is steadfastly loyal to the Yargyez Empire. Wooly rhinoceros herding for subsistence is common in the Zensuke Peninsula, and timber from the Zama Valley is exported to the rest of the Empire.</p>

Last is the Namara Desert to the north, which is home to nomadic tribes who resist Imperial rule. They have not formed an active resistance, but essentially do not respect the laws of the Yargyez Empire and view it as an illegitimate occupier of their nomadic lands.</p>

<h3>Nightglade</h3>

Since the conquest of the Yargyez Empire, the entire region has been in an open civil war between the land-owning Lizardfolk nobles who willingly surrendered to the Yargyez Empire and answer the Imperial governor, and the vast majority of Lizardfolk who view the Yargyez Empire's presence as an illegitimate occupier of their lands. There are numerous deep caves across Nightglade which have served as fortresses for Lizardfolk rebels.</p>
