</center>

<h3>Geographic Summary</h3>

<p>Conliah is the main continent on the world of Arbigard. It is bordered by two oceans: the Talantic Ocean to the east, and the Acivic Ocean to the west. The entire continent is approximately 10.8 million square miles in area, including all land and bodies of water.</p>

<p>The Yargyez Empire has divided the continent into eight provinces, each one the homeland of a distinct race:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Eastgardia</strong> is a temperate coastal region to the east, and the heart of the Yargyez Empire. It is the homeland of all Humans.</li>
<li><strong>Helscar</strong> is a land of icy highlands to the northeast. It is the homeland of the Dwarves.</li>
<li><strong>Middlestone</strong> has endless fertile plains at the very center of Conliah. It is the homeland of the Halflings.</li>
<li><strong>Valorgale</strong> is made of volcanically active barrens and boreal forests to the northwest. It is the homeland of the Dark Elves.</li>
<li><strong>Westerwood</strong> is made of dense, old growth forest to the west. It is the homeland of the Wood Elves.</li>
<li><strong>Fair Island</strong> is a massive island of arid mountains to the southwest. It is the homeland of the High Elves.</li>
<li><strong>Wuthelark</strong> is a land of deserts and jungles to the south. It is the homeland of the Catfolk.</li>
<li><strong>Nightglade</strong> is a marsh to the southeast. It is the homeland of the Lizardfolk.</li>
</ul>

<p>Until very recently, denizens of Conliah believed they were the only continent in the world and no other lands were beyond the oceans. Recently this was proven incorrect by explorers from across the Talantic Ocean, who claim to be from a continent called Lodumpis.</p>

<h3>Cosmological Summary</h3>

<center>
<img title="The cosmos of Nephelai" alt="The continent of Nephelai" src="COSMOS.png" style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 300px;">
</center>

<p>According to the doctrine of the Imperial Cult, there are three realms:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ksylia</strong> has moderation in the quality of soul material and quantity of elemental substance. Arbigard is a flat disc at the center of Ksylia, dividing it into upper and lower hemispheres. This flat disc of unknown size is the surface where mortals dwell. Above Arbigard is a hemisphere called The Skies (the air and the clouds), enclosed by a dome of water called The Firmament. Below Arbigard is a hemisphere called The Neaths (the earth below), enclosed by a dome of magma called The Hade. Ksylia is suspended in a larger cosmos between Asteria and Cthonia.</li>
<li><strong>Asteria</strong> is a realm composed of fine soul material, and very little elemental substance. It is the residence of the Agathoi (good gods) and where souls rest between transmigratory cycles. It is physically above Ksylia, separated from it by The Firmament.</li>
<li><strong>Cthonia</strong> is a realm composed of very degraded soul material, and huge amounts of elemental substance. It is the residence of the Archons (evil gods) and lesser Cthonians, their minions. It is physically below Ksylia, separated from it by The Hade.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is impossible for mortals to freely navigate the wide open realms of Asteria and Cthonia. They can only navigate to spherical subrealms, through an action called phasing. Phasing into a sphere transfers one's whole being into the spherical subrealm. The two circumstances where mortals phase into sphere are either naturally, as part of the transmigration cycle, or through powerful spells.</p>

<p>According to the Imperial Cult, the Agathoi forbid mortals from accessing the Asteric spheres except during transmigration (between their reincarnations in Ksylia). The Agathoi are not all-powerful, however, so there may be exceptions.</p>

<p>In between transmigratory cycles, mortals occupy various Asteric spheres which correspond to their moral conduct in life:</p>

<ul>
<li>Neutral lives: their sphere is like a blank, still space for introspection.</li>
<li>Virtuous lives: the soul is rewarded temporarily by beauty, harmony, and joy.</li>
<li>Wicked lives: the soul is punished temporarily to atone for their actions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some legendary individuals are said to have witnessed the Asteric spheres during life, but these are exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p>Phasing into Cthonic spheres is much more common. The Agathoi have a weaker hold here, so mortals can phase there through magical rituals much more easily. The exact nature of these spheres vary dramatically:</p>

<ul>
<li>Some are formless spheres of raw elements.</li>
<li>Some are domains shaped by Archons reflecting their natures.</li>
</ul>

<p>Archons are not content to reside in their spheres. The desire of all Archons is to breach the boundary with Ksylia and pull mortals into their domains with the ultimate goal of consuming the entire realm of Ksylia. Their capacity to do so is constrained, because Cthonic beings cannot permanently reside in Ksylia. Cthonians who overstay in Ksylia will eventually phase back into their home sphere of Cthonia. However, temporary breaches activated by mortals can create indefinitely durable zones of Cthonic influence. By remaining within these zones, lesser Cthonic beings may reside in Ksylia for prolonged stays. They can even venture for a short time outside of these zones, and safely return to them. Thankfully, these breaches mainly occur in pre-Magellian ruins, from a time when Archon worship was common. However, those who intentionally delve into ancient ruins to banish these threats must exercise great caution against the hordes of Cthonians residing there.</p>

<p>Ksylia does not naturally have spherical subrealms. However, the ancient Magellians knew how to warp space to create miniature spheres that mortals could phase into by the same magical means as Cthonic spheres. Within these spheres, the natural laws of Ksylia generally work as expected. The contents of Ksylic spheres varies depending on the intentions of its Magellian constructor. Portals to these Ksylic spheres were typically placed in lockets, mirrors, doors, and paintings. One specialized use of Ksylic spheres was to hold armies of Stoicheioi: unstable artificial beings of pure elements. The ancient Magellians had the ability to temporarily phase a Stoicheios out of its sphere for use as a temporary ally on the battlefield, and return the Stoicheios back to its sphere before its instability caused rampaging.</p>

<p>In addition to phasing one's whole being, it is possible to magically communicate between Ksylia proper and spherical subrealms. This is common for Devouts who apparently commune with the Agathoi, and Invokers who commune with the Archons. As another example, there are also immortal Steelskulls who solitarily inhabit remote Ksylic spheres silently contemplating the nature of reality. If a mortal in Ksylia attempted to magically communicate with such a Steelskull, it is plausible that the Steelskull would reply.</p>

<h3>Technology</h3>

</div>

<p>The technology level of Conliah is approximately 1100s medieval Europe. Military technology is still based on melee combat, longbows and crossbows, and basic siege weapons. There is very little innovation in enchanting, liming itself to simple enhancements to simple weapons and armor. War Puppets are the most advanced constructs which Conliah can produce.</p>

<p>The Uzvu Confederation from Lodumpis has advanced technology of approximately 1500s Europe. They possess magical firearms which work similarly to early muskets, pistols, and cannons. These firearms rely on yellow soul binding enchantments to operate. The enchanters of Conliah have not been able to reverse engineer how firearms are constructed. They also possess extensive clockwork machinery appropriate to that era, which operates according to non-magical principles. Examples include clock towers, orreries, and wind-up toys. The Uzvu Confederation are perfectly capable of producing the same simple enchantments for weapons and armor as Conliah. In terms of constructs, the Uzvu Confederation is limited to War Puppets like Conliah.</p>

<p>The Magellian Empire was technologically advanced, being capable of magical modification of flesh and the construction of gigantic clockwork guardians. This technology is native to Conliah, but is now lost in ancient ruins.</p>

<h3>Currency</h3>

<ul>
<li>The base unit of currency is the Drachma (ud), which is a silver coin. Three Drachmas can buy one night's stay at an average inn.</li>
<li>A Hemiobol (ho) is a copper coin, worth one-tenth of one Drachma. Two Hemiobols can buy one loaf of bread.</li>
<li>A Dekadrachma (dd) is a gold coin, worth ten Drachmas. One Dekadrachma can buy one day of rations.</li>
<li>A Hekatodrachma (hd) is a platinum coin, worth one-hundred Drachmas. One Hekatodrachma can buy an extravagant banquet for one person.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h3>Calendar</h3>

<p>The year is 366 days long, with 12 months of exactly 30 days each and concluding with 6 intercalary days. There are no leap years. There are four seasons in Conliah, and daylight changes between months. For each month, there is a birthsign associated with that month, and each of the last 6 intercalary days of the year have their own birthsign. The below sunrise and sunset times are not intended as exact, but are provided for convenience.</p>

<h4>Special Languages</h4>

<p>In addition to the languages spoken by those of a particular race, there are languages which are important for other reasons. While they may be obscure, they still have a writing system and structure of a full language.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Cthonic cult languages:</b> Every Cthonic cult has a secret spoken language with its own distinct writing system. The names of the languages are simply given the name of the associated Archon (e.g. "Igedeng's language", "Lize's language") and this is the language cultists use to commune with their deity. In general, any and all beings who are influenced by the specific Archon can understand these secret languages. Examples are intelligent Cthonians, corrupted mortals, and cultists. However, it is also possible to learn a Cthonic cult language through ordinary means.
</li>
<li><b>Classical:</b> The elite language spoken by the ancient Magellian Empire is known as Classical. It is written in Elvish script, and superficially sounds like modern High Elvish to those unfamiliar with both languages. However, the modern language of High Elvish is significantly different from the dialect spoken by the Magellians, such that they are mutually unintelligible. Schoolmages of the Academy of Knowledge generally know Classical, and it is widely known by scholars of the Imperial Cult and the Philosophers Guild. It is the lingua franca of Schoolmages, such that modern spell books are also written in Classical. Intelligent constructs from the Magellian Empire also speak this language.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Slang, Codes, and Signs</h4>

<p>There are many secret ways of communicating which are significant across Conliah. Many of these are derivative of Common or do not meet the criteria of a full language.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>High Tongue:</b> Imperial Cult Devouts, Cloud Devouts, and Ardents all have the ability to speak in a language called High Tongue. This language has no written form, and is supernaturally closed off to outsiders who will hear gibberish. Even so, outsiders in earshot will instantly and certainly be aware that this gibberish is High Tongue. High Tongue cannot be used to convey complex concepts, but may be used to impress abstract concepts upon the mind of listeners who share the language. Technically, these individual concepts may be chained together in a sequence to build a rudimentary language. However, under most circumstances outside of religious use this is excruciatingly and impractically slow. Usually its use is restricted to simple, singular or pairs of two messages in the following categories. The examples are not exhaustive, but the categories themselves are:
  <ul>
    <li>Broad intentions: "I come in peace", "I am hostile", "I surrender"</li>
    <li>Simple commands: "Follow me", "wait", "go away"</li>
    <li>Affirmative answers: "Yes", "no", "mostly yes", "mostly no", "maybe"</li>
    <li>Emotional states: "Danger", "hope", "sorrow"</li>
    <li>Relative time and place: "Now", "later", "ahead", "behind"</li>
    <li>Simple adjectives: "Large", "heavy", "red"</li>
    <li>Simple nouns: "Friend", "animal", "the moon"</li>
    <li>Basic quantities: "None/one/two" (no specific number more than two), "a few", "many", "more", "less"</li>
    <li>Philosophical abstractions: "Justice", "truth", "deception", "good", "evil"</li>
    <li>Intonation: "!", "?"</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li><b>Spies' cant:</b> Operatives of the Artisans Guild have a secret code which allows them to insert secret messages into ordinary-sounding conversations, typically in Common.</li>
<li><b>Escapist trail codes:</b> Followers of the Escapist school of thought in the Philosophers Guild leave trail markers which are subtle to the untrained eye, but whose meanings are unmistakable to those trained in it.</li>
<li><b>Rhyming slang:</b> The lowest ranking soldiers of all martial factions native to Conliah are familiar with rhyming slang. This type of slang involves replacing a word with a rhyming phrase, then dropping the portion of the phrase which rhymes, which prevents analysis by outsiders. Examples of factions where this slang is widespread are the Belligerantes, the Royal Guard, the Artisans Guild, Tyvenlads, and Lizardfolk rebels. This informal variant of Common exists to obscure messages between <i>ranks within a faction</i> rather than <i>between factions</i>. For instance, a soldier can discreetly fraternize with a prisoner of an opposing faction if they both know rhyming slang. Attentive outsiders may catch on that rhyming slang is being used, but they will not have the slightest clue what is actually being said. When a low ranking soldier is promoted to the role of an officer, knowledge of rhyming slang is quickly lost. That is because the upkeep of knowledge of rhyming slang requires mnemonics embedded in the day-to-day life of a low ranking soldier, which an officer is required to alienate from. If someone retires at a low rank without being promoted to an officer, knowledge of rhyming slang is retained because this self-imposed alienation does not occur.</li>
<li><b>Oundar Edturn:</b> The name Oundar Edturn is derived from the phrase "Turned Around". Beggars, prisoners, thieves, and criminals of all kinds across Conliah are familiar with Oundar Edturn. This type of slang is an informal variant of Common that involves swapping the syllables within each word. It is at risk of being analyzed if someone is aware that Oundar Edturn is being used, but it takes great practice to speak and hear fluently. Due to its simplicity to learn and practice, it has become the standard language of the criminal underworld.</li>
<li><b>Arcane shorthand:</b> While Schoolmages write in Classical in a structured setting, it is very common in the field to use shorthand, a practice dating back to the Magellian Empire. By means of this shorthand, it is possible to convey several words of Classical in a few brief strokes. While it is designed for speed and space efficiency rather than security, this shorthand is totally illegible except to the one who wrote it. It is necessary to cast a spell for one Schoolmage to decipher another's shorthand, which converts it to the full Classical in the caster's vision.</li>
