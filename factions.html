<h2 class="page-title">Factions of Conliah</h2>

<p><em>KAITO THE HALFLING: What is most just for an empire: firstly to destroy the worse faction and enthrone the better, secondly to enthrone the better faction and force the worse to submit, or thirdly to reconcile them and neither destroy the worse or force it to submit?</em></p>

<p><em>SITAROPHILUS THE HIGH ELF: Obviously the third option.</em></p>

<p><em>KAITO THE HALFLING: That would be the most just option. And clearly, the empire who chooses the third option will not be at war, but will be at peace. Therefore, the empire which is just will be at peace with itself.</em></p>

<p><em>SITAROPHILUS THE HIGH ELF: Again, obviously so.</em></p>

<p><em>KAITO THE HALFLING: And the empire is now at war with itself, is it not?</em></p>

<h3>The Yargyez Empire</h3>

<p>The Yargyez Empire is the dominant political force on the continent of Conliah. The center of power in the Yargyez Empire is the royal palace in Inton, Eastgardia. The Yargyez Emperor is the absolute ruler of the Yargyez Empire. The Grand Vizier oversees the Imperial Council and reports directly to the Yargyez Emperor.</p>

<p>The Imperial Council handles the day-to-day affairs of the Empire. It is composed of viziers, Royal Guard generals, and religious scholars. The Imperial Council decides the law and its practical enforcement across Conliah. They appoint provincial governors for each province across the continent, and have the power to revoke provincial governors' authority at-will.</p>

<p>The banner of the Yargyez features a white thunderbolt with three zags on a blue background.</p>

<h3>The Royal Guard</h3>

<p>The Yargyez Royal Guard are the military and law enforcement of the Yargyez Empire. They are a disciplined fighting force that works to suppress dissent.</p>

<h3>The Uzvu Confederation</h3>

<p>The Uzvu Confederation are a foreign state from a newly encountered continent named Lodumpis. They are a technologically advanced civilization that views its military incursion into Conliah as divinely sanctioned.</p>

<p>Their symbol is a white greataxe standing up straight, with three tulips at the base. The tulips are red, orange, and yellow with green stems. Behind the logo is a black background.</p>

<h3>The Belligerantes</h3>

<p>The Belligerantes are a continent-spanning paramilitary organization with public-facing and private operations. As a public organization they operate as blades for hire, assisting smaller settlements that the Empire will not send aid to. They shun magic and stealth as cowardly, favoring marching into battle in heavy plate armor with swords and shields.</p>

<p>There are about 2,000 members of the Belligerantes: approximately 1,600 infantry soldiers and 400 cavalry, and a small number of higher officers. For the higher ranking officers the hierarchy is the Supreme Commander, Captain, and Lieutenant. Below Lieutenant, the hierarchy divides between infantry and cavalry. For infantry the hierarchy is Sergeant, Corporal, Senior Private, and Private. For cavalry the hierarchy is Marshal, Brigadier, Senior Cavalier, Cavalier. There are approximately 24 Lieutenants across Conliah, and there are 8 Captains: one Captain for each province.</p>

<p>The keystone officers are the Lieutenants, who operate out of chapterhouses. Lieutenants have two roles: firstly, they intake mercenary jobs and submit them to their Captains for review and prioritization. Secondly, they are the commanding officers of infantry Sergeants and cavalry Marshals on-the-ground during missions.</p>

<p>The physical presence of the Belligerantes is through the chapterhouses. The Belligerantes headquarters is a large chapterhouse located in Omugi, Middlestone. All of their members are volunteers who perform various occupations when not in combat. The most common occupations are artisans and laborers. There are also passionate academics who volunteer out of a desire to defend Conliah, as well as nobles who occupy many of the higher officer roles.</p>

<p>Due to the outsized responsibility of the Lieutenants, there are several consequences:</p>

<ul>
<li>They tend to be more personally invested in the work than officers higher and lower than them</li>
<li>They have outsized influence and may form subfactions of loyal subordinate officers, which threaten the integrity of the whole organization</li>
<li>They are often involved in this line of work for opportunistic personal gain rather than altruism or honest pay.</li>
</ul>

<p>The emblem used by the Belligerantes is a long black horizontal line below a solid red triangle, representing a stylized mountain.</p>

<h3>The Artisans Guild</h3>

<p>The Artisans Guild is a price-fixing monopolist organization that represents the interests of large urban manufacturers against both merchants and political powers. They represent various kinds of craftspeople such as potion makers, blacksmiths, leathersmiths, and enchanters of magical weapons and armor.</p>

<p>The highest rank in the Artisans Guild is one Manufacturer Supreme, who resides in Eithar, Helscar. The Manufacturer Supreme is elected by a council of eight Syndics (one per province). Below Syndics are Master Manufacturers, divided by craft. Below the Master Manufacturers are skilled and unskilled crafters, who are the lowest rank.</p>

<p>There is an operative wing of the Artisans Guild. Their field agents are trained in combat and stealth. Additionally, they are equipped with advanced magical technology stolen from the Uzvu and ancient Magellian ruins. Each Syndic commands several superintendents. Each superintendent operates a safehouse, and commands several field agents from that safehouse. This operative wing serves multiple roles the Artisans Guild requires:</p>

<ul>
<li>They ensure the functioning of commerce so that urban manufacturers have secure buyers for their wares. Practically, that can involve threatening merchants, overthrowing lords, and negotiating with factions otherwise hostile to the Yargyez Empire.</li>
<li>They advance the state-of-the-art of magical technology in Conliah. Practically, that involves stealing magical technology from the Uzvu or searching for rumored advanced technology in Magellian ruins.</li>
<li>They spy on other factions to monitor the development of events in Conliah, and report their findings back to the Syndic.</li>
</ul>

<p>The symbol used by the Artisans Guild is an eight-toothed gear with an eye in the center.</p>

<h3>The Philosophers Guild</h3>

<p>The Philosophers Guild is a coalition of heterodox thinkers who associate for mutual protection. They have founded lodges across the continent and sponsor expeditions into Magellian ruins in search of ancient artifacts and tomes. There is no hierarchy above the lodges themselves, and individual lodges are associated or disavowed from the Philosophers Guild in a decentralized manner. Within a lodge itself, there is only one formal leader called the Lodgemaster. All other members are of equal rank, although some may be more advanced in their intellectual engagement. Lodges often fall under one of eight schools of thought listed below. This is not an absolute rule, and individual lodges can and do follow other schools of thought not listed.</p>

<h4>The Quietists</h4>

<p>The Quietist school of thought emerged in Wuthelark, based on their epistemological claim that truth can only be revealed by inward and outward silence. Their worldview rejected that it is necessary to act in the world or engage discursively to arrive at truth. Their goal is to defend the practice of solitude and silence as a pathway to truth. In their lodges, they offer silent meditation rooms where practicioners seek to obtain visions through total silence. Their followers have the ability to cast Ardent Magic, but only in complete darkness and silence. They are resistant to silencing spells, and have enhanced vision in darkness. Their master lodge is located in Wuthelark. Their lodge seal is a lion, sleeping on a hill. Their harshest critics are the Destructivists, and their sympathizers are the Refinists, the Escapists, and the Symphonists.</p>

<h4>The Refinists</h4>

<p>The Refinist school of thought emerged in Westerwood, based on their epistemological claim that truth requires individuals to cultivate their own moral improvement. Their worldview rejected that unthinking submission to authority or complete disengagement with the world were pathways to truth. Their goal is to defend the practice of contemplative, moral self-improvement as a pathway to truth. In their lodges, they keep a library of the meditative diaries of lodge members. Instead of discussing philosophy, they encourage lodge members to keep diaries and read the stored diaries of others. Their followers have the ability to cast Ardent Magic, but only if their actions are grounded in deep contemplation of the moral facts of the situation. They are resistant to silencing spells, and have the ability to resist dominating magic if it forces them to commit evil. Their master lodge is located in Westerwood. Their lodge seal is a wolf and a dog, mutually biting each other. Their harshest critics are the Freneticists, and their symphathizers are the Quietists, the Refusalists, and the Legalists.</p>

<h4>The Escapists</h4>

<p>The Escapist school of thought emerged in Valorgale, based on their epistemological claim that truth requires individuals to commune with unfiltered nature. Their worldview rejected that truth could be found through language or social activity, which corrupted the purity of nature itself. They do not completely reject social interaction, but purposefully agree to it on a temporary basis until individuals are prepared to abandon society and live as hermits. Their goal is to defend individual communion with nature as a means of obtaining the truth. In their lodges, they discuss less about philosophy and more about the practical hermitization process and documenting safe pathways to sites of natural beauty. Their actual practices take place outside their lodges, where they gradually spend more and more time outside of civilization and more time in untouched nature. Their followers have the ability to cast Ardent Magic, which becomes more and more potent as they become more socially isolated. They have an extraordinary knowledge of geography and survivalism. Their master lodge is located in Valorgale. Their lodge seal is a caged racoon, with its head peeking outside the cage bars. Their harshest critics are the Legalists, and their sympathizers are the Quietists, the Refualists, and the Freneticists.</p>

<h4>The Refusalists</h4>

<p>The Refusalist school of thought emerged in Nightglade, based on their epistemological claim that truth can only emerge when individuals actively contradict the dominant order of society. Their worldview rejected that truth could be found through purposeful social activity whatsoever, and society is a contaminant of pure individual will. They do not completely reject social interaction, but mutually agree to it on a provisional basis. Their goal is to defend individual autonomous action as a mean of obtaining the truth. In their lodges, they endlessly discuss philosophy for personal satisfaction, with the mutual understanding that no amount of discussion will lead to truth. Their actual practices take place outside of their lodges, where they make a point of living contrary to the dominant social order as beggars, thieves, and vagabonds. Their followers have the ability to cast Ardent Magic, but only when they are committing acts which contradict the dominant social order. They have resistance to mentally dominating magic, due to their active day-to-day resistance to society. Their master lodge is located in Nightglade. Their lodge seal is of two oxes formerlly yoked together: one is still yoked but the other has broken away from the yoke in rage. Their harshest critics are the Symphonists and their sympathizers are the Escapists, the Refinists, and the Destructivists.</p>

<h4>The Symphonists</h4>

<p>The Symphonist school of thought emerged in Fair Island, based on the epistemological claim that truth can only emerge through the social creation of beauty. Their worldview rejected that truth could be found through quiet meditation or purely rational discourse. Their goal is to defend aesthetic production as a means of obtaining truth. In their lodges, they host various activities involving the collective production of art such as massive paintings where each member fills in a section, musical productions, or dramatic performances. Their followers have the ability to cast Ardent Magic by means of witnessing grandeur, transcending their spirit to a sublime state. They can passively detect sources of extraordinary beauty, such as ancient buried megalographies. Their master lodge is located in Fair Island. Their lodge seal is a group of doves playing trumpets. Their harshest critics are the Refusalists, and their sympathizers are the Legalists, the Quietists, and the Freneticists.</p>

<h4>The Legalists</h4>

<p>The Legalist school of thought emerged in Eastgardia, based on the epistemological claim that truth is only accessible through complex social structures which reward correct thinking and acting. Their worldview rejected that individuals can ever transcend a social understanding of truth, but that the whole society needs to engage discursively to develop its understanding. Their goal is to defend the law and established social structures as necessary to preserve a coherent understanding of the truth. In their lodges, they host debates with large audiences to decide the better argument, and engage with each other through open letters. Their followers have the ability to cast Ardent Magic, but only when their actions are aligned with the overall will of the masses. They have an extraordinary ability to persuade others concerning why obedience to the law is actually for their own benefit, even in the middle of an evil act. Their master lodge is located in Eastgardia. Their lodge seal is one elephant holding a compass, and another elephant holding a straightedge, bound together by a rope. Their harshest critics are the Escapists, and their sympathizers are the Symphonists, the Refinists, and the Destructivists.</p>

<h4>The Freneticists</h4>

<p>The Freneticist school of thought emerged in Middlestone, based on the epistemological claim that truth can be obtained through extreme states of consciousness. Their worldview rejected that reason has any privileged claim to a correct understanding of reality. Their goal is to defend frenzy as a legitimate path to truth and tear down the monopoly of rationalism in philosophical circles. In their lodges, they engage in rituals that induce frenzy in their participants in order to obtain transcendent visions. Their followers have the ability to cast Ardent Magic by means of self-inducing a frenzied trance. They are difficult to persuade and intimidate because of their purpose-driven irrationalism. Their master lodge is located in Middlestone. Their lodge seal is a snake drinking from a goblet, with its body coiled in a spiral. Their harshest critics are the Refinists, and their sympathizers are the Symphonists, the Destructivists, and the Escapists.</p>

<h4>The Destructivists</h4>

<p>The Destructivist school of thought emerged in Helscar, based on their epistemological claim that knowledge of truth requires struggle against the morally corrupt majority. Their worldview rejected that discourse leads to truth, because the dominant social structure rewards evil. Their goal is to hypothetically defend periodic vast uprisings of zealots to cleanse the land from corruption. In their lodges, they actively train in combat which mixes martial and magical methods. Their followers have the ability to cast Ardent Magic, but only when they are actively enraged by social injustice. Their vigilance against an ever-present evil gives them a passive ability to detect deception and traps. Their master lodge is located in Helscar. Their lodge seal is a sheep standing on two legs, holding a sword and shield. Their harshest critics are the Quietists, and their sympathizers are the Freneticists, the Legalists, and the Refusalists.</p>

<h3>The Academy of Knowledge</h3>

<p>The Academy of Knowledge is the largest magical organization in Conliah, and has direct ties to the Yargyez Empire. It is dedicated to the open, systematic study of magic.</p>

<p>Each university is overseen by a Rectormage, who is appointed by an Archmage Provincial. Likewise, the Rectormage appoints Chairmages for each department of study. There are eight Archmage Provincials, one for each province. Above all of them stand the Archmage General in Inton, Eastgardia.</p>

<p>In addition to learning the principles of schoolmagic, the universities also emphasize civil, moral, and philosophical education to ensure graduates employ magic in line with the Yargyez Empire's wishes.</p>

<p>The symbol used by the Academy of Knowledge is a tetractys of white, four-pointed stars on a blue background. White suns and white moons on a blue background are also commonly used symbols.</p>

<h3>The Imperial Cult</h3>

<p>The Imperial Cult is the official religion of the Yargyez Empire. Each Agathos has its own clerical hierarchy and rites. The Yargyez Emperor is considered the ultimate head of the Imperial Cult, who guides the Archbishops of the Six Guardians. At the head of each cult of a Guardian Agathos is an Archbishop, who spiritually leads that specific cult. Below Archbishops are Bishops, whose main purpose is to serve as intermediaries between a group of Priests and the Archbishop. Priests are the leaders of a particular temple, who directly serve the local community. Below priests are Seminarians, who are training at a temple to become full-fledged priests.</p>



<h4>The Order of Iazus</h4>

<p>Imperial Cult Inquisitors are agents of the Order of Iazus, and they are dedicated to actively smiting evil across Conliah. Their mandate is to suppress Cthonic cult activity, gather intelligence regarding Cthonic magic and rituals, and to recover and destroy Cthonic artifacts. The local priest of Iazus will observe rumors of Cthonic rites being practiced, and send an Inquisitor cell to investigate the rumor. Then, the Inquisitors will conclude their investigation, take appropriate action, and report their findings back to the priest. The local law enforcers must yield to their Inquisitors during an investigation, backed by imperial law. They have the right to confiscate evidence, detain suspected individuals, and punish proven cultists with lethal force.</p>

<p>A typical Inquisitor cell has three members.</p>

<ul>
<li>The lead inquisitor is the most experienced, and primarily focuses on martial presence. Their purpose is to make critical decisions for the cell, and speak on behalf of the cell. They have past experience in the other roles, but delegate to the other cell members.</li>
<li>The field researcher is often the least experienced member of the cell. Their purpose is to accumulate theoretical knowledge of cult activity, and actively search for evidence of cult activity.</li>
<li>The exorcist has a magical focus, and has the greatest knowledge on actively purifying locations and objects which are imbued with Cthonic magic.</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of contraband which the Inquisitors will seize are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cthonic amulets and tokens</li>
<li>Cursed scrolls and tomes</li>
<li>Weapons and armor enchanted with Cthonic magic</li>
<li>Various other artifacts with detectable Cthonic energy</li>
</ul>

<p>The Tyvenlad are a decentralized network of criminal syndicates operating the black market economy across Conliah. Each Tyvenlad syndicate has its own territory and hierarchical structure, but there is no rank above the leader of a single syndicate. Instead, the leaders of syndicates negotiate and compromise with each other according to customs and informal rules of engagement in order to prevent feuding between thieves.</p>

<p>Within a single Tyvenlad syndicate, there is a common hierarchy. A Bandit King or Bandit Queen is the leader of a single syndicate. A Consigliere serves to arbitrate disputes between syndicates. The Consigliere reports directly to the Bandit King/Queen, but does not have any subordinate reports and is forbidden from succeeding the Bandit King/Queen. Also reporting directly to the Bandit King/Queen are one or more Captains, who each command a crew. The lowest rank are Soldiers, who perform the grunt work.</p>

</div>
<div class="break-page"></div>

<p>Although low-ranking members do not participate, Bandit Kings and Bandit Queens are intermediaries between a syndicate and the Archon Ogzim, and they make sacrifices to him for his blessing. The Tyvenlad are extensions of Ogzim's physical presence in Conliah.</p>

<h4>The Morderlad Fraternities</h4>

<p>The Morderlad fraternities are a decentralized underground association of assassins-for-hire. They worship Uluzing, the Mistress of Ends. Each fraternity house has its own High Priest who directly communes with Uluzing to receive notice of someone praying to Uluzing for her cult to perform an assassination.

Some of these animated plants are stationary, and some are mobile.</p>
