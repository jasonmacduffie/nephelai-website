<p><em>MEDIOCRATES: I cannot tell how you feel about the speeches of my accusers, people of Atherita. I heard their speeches, and even I forgot who I was, as was their intended effect. Nothing they have said is remotely true. Even so, there was one falsehood that stood out to me, regarding the force of my eloquence. They should be ashamed for accusing me of such, because their falsehood would be revealed as soon as I would speak.</em></p>

<p>Nephelai is a continent-spanning fantasy setting for use with any tabletop fantasy RPG. This website is designed to be a spoiler-free player resource, but there are a few bits of information every player character ought to know on the first day of the year 189 YE:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Where Are You:</strong> You are on the continent of Conliah. Conliah was thought to be the only continent in the world, surrounded by endless ocean, until explorers from a continent to the east called Lodumpis landed on its shores nineteen years ago.</li>
<li><strong>History:</strong> In ancient times, there was a High Elven empire called the Magellian Empire. They had incredible magical technology which is now lost to time, and they mysteriously collapsed. 188 years ago, the Yargyez Empire was formed which reunited all of Conliah under Human rule.</li>
<li><strong>Races:</strong> There are eight major races in Conliah: the Humans of Eastgardia, the Dwarves of Helscar, the Halflings of Middlestone, the Dark Elves of Valorgale, the Wood Elves of Westerwood, the High Elves of Fair Island, the Catfolk of Wuthelark, and the Lizardfolk of Nightglade. All eight provinces are ruled by the Yargyez Empire, a Human empire whose capital is in the city of Inton, Eastgardia.</li>
<li><strong>Religion:</strong> There are good gods called the Agathoi, and evil gods called the Archons. The Imperial Cult worships the Agathoi (especially the Six Guardians) and hunts down those who worship the Archons. Archon worship is uncommon, but Archons grant their worshippers immense power in exchange for spiritual corruption.</li>
<li><strong>Cosmology:</strong> There are three realms of existence: Ksylia, Asteria, and Cthonia. The Agathoi reside in Asteria, the Archons reside in Cthonia, and mortals reside in Ksylia. Ksylia is further divided into three parts: The Skies above are the open atmosphere, the Neaths below are a network of deep caverns, and Arbigard is the surface where the majority of mortal affairs take place.</li>
<li><strong>Magic:</strong> Soul material is present in all three realms of existence. Soul material grants animate beings their life force, and magic wielders gain powers by manipulating this soul material. However, magic wielders possess different magical powers based on which realm their soul material is sourced from.</li>
<li><strong>Threat Ecology:</strong> Conliah has a distinct threat ecology which is different from other classic fantasy settings. Two classic categories of "always evil humanoids" and "magical beasts" are absent, and must be reimagined as belonging to one of the below categories.
<ul>
<li><strong>Sentient mortals</strong> are creatures capable of forming their own societies and politics. Examples are Humans, Elves, Dwarves, Halflings, and Orcs.</li>
<li><strong>Mundane beasts</strong> may be majestic, strange, or dangerous, but they are essentially mundane. Examples are pterodactyls, giant ants and carnivorous apes.</li>
<li><strong>Cthonically corrupt mortals</strong> are members of the sentient mortal races, but who have changed their physical form through interaction with Cthonic magic. Examples are Iavols and Draklings.</li>
<li><strong>Cthonian invaders</strong> are aberrations from Cthonia itself, temporarily present in Ksylia itself as an army of destruction. Examples are Nightcreeps and Tormentors.</li>
<li><strong>Artificial beings</strong> are products of arcane manipulation, which has transformed life or granted life to an inanimate vessel. Examples are War Puppets, Steelskulls and Flesh Mutants.</li>
<li><strong>Undead beings</strong> are a special kind of artificial being, whose only universal traits are (1) their existence perverts the cycle of life and death, either spiritually or physically and (2) they are Cthonically corrupt. Examples are Ghosts, Zombies, and Blood Monsters.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Factions:</strong> You have heard about several factions with continent-spanning impact:
<ul>
<li><strong>The Yargyez Empire:</strong> The Empire was established 188 years ago by Humans from Eastgardia. The Yargyez Emperor is the head of religion through the Imperial Cult, military through the Royal Guard, and law through the Imperial Council.</li>
<li><strong>The Uzvu Confederation:</strong> A confederation of Orcs, Goblins, and Ogres landed on the shores of Conliah nineteen years ago. They have rapidly started invading the land, declaring their domination of Conliah divinely mandated.</li>
<li><strong>The Academy of Knowledge:</strong> The Academy is the largest magical organization in Conliah, and is dedicated to the systematic study of magic. Many magic wielders are taught in their universities.</li>
<li><strong>The Philosophers Guild:</strong> A strange group of philosophical lodges across Conliah have formed a guild to defend free thinking against orthodoxy. They are not outright Archon worshippers, but they are viewed as suspicious by the Yargyez Empire.</li>
<li><strong>The Artisans Guild:</strong> Urban manufacturers across Conliah are members of the Artisans Guild. The Guild also has an operative wing of covert agents who use stealth and advanced magical technology.</li>
<li><strong>The Belligerantes:</strong> The Belligerantes are a martial organization that shuns magic and stealth in favor of physical combat. They are mercenaries for hire in rural areas the Empire cannot protect.</li>
</ul></li>
