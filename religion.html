<p><em>MEDIOCRATES: What makes a person holy?</em></p>

<p><em>DYSTHYPHRO: To be holy is to root out and destroy unholiness: whatever is Cthonic, corrupt, and wicked. The people who dedicate their being to fight against it are called holy. Likewise, failing to root out and destroy unholiness is also unholiness. That definition seems sound, to me.</em></p>

<h4>Agathos Worship</h4>

<p>The pantheon of the Yargyez Empire recognizes six major Agathoi named the Six Guardians. They are worshipped in public temples and holidays recognized by the Empire. Each Agathos has its own clerical hierarchy and rites, and provinces often combine these with syncretic traditions. Besides these Six Guardians there are also many minor Agathoi who are acknowledged by the Empire as having legitimate cults. The below list of minor Agathoi is not exhaustive, but includes the better-known ones.</p>

<p>Outside of the Imperial Cult, there are religious factions of High Elves and Wood Elves who advocate Burrueism, considering the Imperial Cult to be a distortion. They seek to restore the original practices of Agathos worship as spread by the Magellian Empire, including a belief in Elven racial superiority to other mortal races and a belief that Burrue is an emanation of Gora herself.</p>

<h4>Archon Worship</h4></div>

<p>Worship of the Archons is forbidden by law. Even so their cults persist, as their power is too alluring to resist. Shrines to them can be found in ancient ruins, concealed temples, and the basements of shady nobles.</p>

<p>There are many contradictory accounts regarding mythic history and cosmology given by Cthonic cultists. They vary between different cults, and even within the same cults. Many Archon-worshippers do not hold any opinion whatsoever on the topic of religion, and relate to the Archons in a purely transactional way. However, for cultists who do give an account, there are several points of agreement which never vary. The Archons themselves attest to these points.</p>

<p>First, the Archons and Cthonia are primordial. Ksylia and its inhabitants were created afterwards. Second, the structure of Ksylia is that of concentric spheres. The outermost sphere separating it from Cthonia is the Hade. Then the Neaths, with its hollow surface of Arbigard. The Skies are at the center. Thus, "up" is at the center of Ksylia, and "down" is away from its center. The third point of agreement is that blue soul material was somehow invented by the weakest mortals of Ksylia, in order to oppose the Archons. The Magellian Empire weaponized blue soul material against the Archons, and taught the false doctrine that weakness is good, and strength is evil. The Agathoi were an invented story to justify this inversion. Of course, the Firmament and Asteria do not exist. The Magellian and Yargyez Empires wrongly suppressed the ultimate law of nature, that justice is the advantage of the stronger.</p>

<p>The below list of Archons is not exhaustive. There are many lesser-known Cthonic cults in Conliah, and Lodumpans know of Archons that Conlians had never heard of. Likewise, only some Archons known in Conliah are also known in Lodumpis, and Archons which are known in both continents are always given different names and interpreted with different emphases.</p>

<h4>Ancestor Veneration</h4>

<p>While the Imperial Cult does not officially recognize its practice, the veneration of ancestors is widespread across Conliah. It is tolerated as long as it's of a more respectful and sentimental nature, and does not interfere with transmigration. Rituals that bind souls to a location are illegal, and inquisitors of the Order of Iazus punish those who practice such ancestor veneration. Ancestor veneration is complicated to regulate, because many of its practitioners either do not understand they are binding souls or do not understand the harm of doing so. These are the major races which practice ancestor veneration:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dwarves believe that their honored dead are granted a unique sphere in Asteria named Erunhall, which is an eternal feast. Their practices include feasts held at burial mounds and burying possessions with the dead.</li>
<li>Halflings believe that spirits linger in Arbigard until they are given proper burial rights, or else they will become restless spirits. Their practices include shrines placed in crypts and annual feasts in rememberance of the dead.</li>
<li>Dark Elves believe that even after death, spirits remain connected to the physical location they were buried. Their practices include shrines placed in clan tombs and ritualistic chanting intended to ground the spirits of the dead in Arbigard.</li>
<li>Lizardfolk believe that even after death, spirits remain connected to the ecology of the marsh. Their practices include carving fetishes believed to be imbued with spirits and the consumption of hallucinogenic plants which they believe allow them to commune with their ancestors.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Cloud Worship</h4>

<p>The practice of worshipping clouds appears several times in the history of Conliah. It is a mystery how it arose independently several times. Those who believe in Cloud Worship suggest that its independent development is proof of its truth.</p>

<ul>
<li>During the Age of Might Makes Right, the Wood Elves of the Ak Ates Mountains in southern Westerwood worshipped the clouds. However, this was displaced by Agathos worship by the Aksu Khaganate, and almost nobody alive today knows that this was practiced.</li>
<li>The Cloudruled at the end of the Magellian Empire also advocated for cloud worship, stating that lightning comes from the clouds and not Iazus.</li>
<li>The Uzvu Confederation believe the clouds are the true gods of this world. From their worldview, the Agathos and Archon cults are equally heretical, and they view the extermination of these cults as part of their civilizing mission. While this belief superficially resembles the Cloudruled who taught philosophy towards the end of the Magellian Empire, the Uzvu claim they are unaware of who the Cloudruled were.</li>
</ul>

<p>Scholars of the Yargyez Empire have attempted to document the religious beliefs of the Uzvu. Their best understanding is that the Uzvu believe that the creator Demvegaz created one world of Ksylia, and inhabited it with mortal beings in the Skies, the Neaths, and Arbigard between them. However, Demvegaz gave all mortal beings free will. The Archons are mortal beings who originated in the Neaths, and rebelled against Demvegaz. The Archons constructed the Hade to divide the Neaths into the "Near Neaths" and the "Far Neaths", and made the Far Neaths their fortress against the wrath of Demvegaz. They caused suffering to the surface mortals of Arbigard, and Demvegaz pitied the mortals. To help them, Demvegaz sacrificed her body and became the clouds.</p>

<p>In Lodumpis, the Uzvu already have extensive experience in rooting out Archon worship. They view Cthonic cults as utterly foolish, but they also openly study red soul material with less stigma than in Conliah's history. However, they have never heard of the Agathoi or any similar concept. The Uzvu speculate that the Agathoi are a misinterpretation of Demvegaz's power by false equivalence to the Archons. They deny the existence of Asteria as a separate realm and likewise the existence of the Firmament. Instead, they believe that green souls return to the highest stratum of the clouds, disintegrate and reform, then return to Arbigard. Therefore, each new green soul is a completely different person. Furthermore, blue soul material originates in the clouds instead of another realm.</p>

<p>The Uzvu believe in a different structure of Ksylia than the Imperial Cult. They believe that Ksylia has layers of finite height but infinite breadth, and each layer is stacked flat on top of each other. From top to bottom, the layers are the Skies, Arbigard (not actually one of the layers, but the surface), the Near Neaths (which the Imperial Cult and Cthonic cults call the Neaths), the Hade, and the Far Neaths (which the Imperial Cult and Cthonic cults call Cthonia).</p>

<p>Devouts of cloud worship have powers identical to devouts of the Six Guardians, but which Guardian their powers resemble changes depending on the formation of clouds and precipitation.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>No Clouds, No Rain:</strong> Their powers resemble devouts of Burrue.</li>
<li><strong>Partly Cloudy, No Rain:</strong> Their powers resemble devouts of Inidilt.</li>
<li><strong>Overcast, No Rain:</strong> Their powers resemble devouts of Lidnozie.</li>
<li><strong>Light shower:</strong> Their powers resemble devouts of Ereng.</li>
<li><strong>Thunderstorm:</strong> Their powers resemble devouts of Iazus.</li>
<li><strong>Rainbow visible:</strong> Their powers resemble devouts of Izdoeng.</li>
