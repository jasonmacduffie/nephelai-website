<h2 class="page-title">Races of Conliah</h2>



<p><em>KAITO THE HALFLING: Tell me, friends, were the laws written by an Agathos or by a mortal?</em></p>

<p><em>ASEM THE WOOD ELF: An Agathos, Kaito, but I do not know which one. Among us Wood Elves we say Iazus made the laws, but High Elves like Sitarophilus say Burrue did it. Is that right, Sitarophilus?</em></p>

<p><em>SITAROPHILUS THE HIGH ELF: You are right we do, Asem, but I also do not really know.</em></p>

<p><em>-- The Thirty-Third Cloudruled Dialogue: The Warlords</em></p>

<div class="break-column"><h3>Multiple Race Heritage</h3></div>

<p>Although their exact origins are unknown, most races of Conliah share a common lineage which allows full interbreeding between them. This is true for Humans, Dwarves, Halflings, High Elves, Dark Elves, and Wood Elves. Their offspring have traits which are the average of the multiple racial backgrounds. Catfolk and Lizardfolk are exceptions, as biologically distinct species. The possibility of offspring between the races of Conliah and the races of the Uzvu Confederation are unknown at this point. Sentient beings of Cthonic origin are also incapable of producing offspring with mundane sentient beings.</p>
